title: Loom Config File
description: Loom Configuration Options
!------

Each LoomScript project contains a file in the root project directory called 'loom.config'. This file contains a list of settings that can be used on the native side of things, or accessed via script.

## Setting Configuration Properties

To set a property in your loom.config, you can either modify your file directly, or use the 'loom config' command like so:

~~~console
$ loom config propertyName value
=> "value"
~~~

To set nested properties, use dot(.) syntax:

~~~console
$ loom config nested.property.name value
=> "value"
~~~

To add a global config value (such as an iOS signing identity), use the --global flag:

~~~console
$ loom config --global globalPropertyName value
=> "value"
~~~

| app_type             | [ `"default"`,           | The type of app; this determines whether it is run in a window as |
|                      |   `"console"` ]          | a normal app, or as a console app using loomexec.                 |

| display.borderless   | [ `true`, `false` ]      | If `true`, the app window has no borders. Note that on some       |
|                      |                          | platforms a small border might still appear if `resizable` is set |
|                      |                          | to `true` to allow resizing. Set `resizable` to `false` to hide   |
|                      |                          | that border as well.                                              |

|                      |                          | This is similar to setting `maximized` and `borderless` to `true` |
|                      |                          | and `resizable` to `false`.                                       |

## Logging Options

The Loom SDK includes a lightweight logging framework. All log output is associated with a log group. Log groups provide a name, an enabled toggle, and a filter level (controlling what severity of log message is displayed).

You can set the logging settings for a particular group like so:

~~~text
{
    "log": {
        // Global default filter level set to warning or higher
        "level": "warn",

        "sdl": {
            // Enables all log groups starting with 'sdl'
            "enabled": true,

             // Sets the filter level for 'sdl' groups to allow all debug messages and above
            "level": "debug",

            // Applies to 'sdl.error' specifically and overrides the above
            "error": {

                // Disable all 'sdl.error' messages
                "enabled": false
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~

Additionally, the command line switch `--verbose` overrides the global default level, setting it to `verbose`.

**Available Log Filter Levels:**

* `debug` or `verbose` - Debug level usually used for all kinds of usually not relevant information, but often useful when something doesn't work right and you want to figure out what's going on behind the scenes.
* `default` or `info` or empty string - Messages of informational nature - a quick overview of what is happening.
* `warn` or `warning` - Something happened that wasn't expected. It's usually not a big problem, but can be an indicator of one.
* `error` - A really bad thing happened and you should probably fix it.
* `quiet` or `none` - Disables output, no messages should use this level.

All the internal log group names are <= 10 characters long for consistency of output.
