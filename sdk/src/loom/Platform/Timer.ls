/**
*  A Timer counts milliseconds and triggers delegates when it starts, completes, or is halted.
*
*  * Calling `start()` or `reset()` will call the `onStart` delegate
*  * Calling `pause()` will call the `onPause` delegate
*  * Calling `stop()` will call the `onStop` delegate
*  * The `onComplete` delegate is called when the timer's elapsed time exceeds its `delay` value
*
*  By default, a Timer will not repeat; once started, it will run to completion,
*  call the `onComplete` delegate, and be done.
*
*  Setting the `repeatCount` property to zero will cause the timer to cycle until
*  `stop()` is called. If a non-zero `repeatCount` is set, the timer will complete
*  the specified amount of times and then stop. The default is 1.
*
*  The `currentCount` property keeps track of the number of cycles the timer has completed.
*
*  The snippet below shows how to instantiate and start a repeating timer instance,
*  reacting to its `onComplete` event, which will fire approximately once per second:
*
*  ```as3
*  private function onTimerComplete(timer:Timer):void
*  {
*      trace('the timer has completed ' +timer.currentCount +' cycles.')
*      trace('the last cycle lasted ' +timer.elapsed +'ms.');
*  }
*
*  var timer:Timer = new Timer(1000, 0);
*  timer.onComplete = onTimerComplete;
*  timer.start();
*  ```
